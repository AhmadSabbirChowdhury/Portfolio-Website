# Portfolio-Website
#### https://ahmadsabbirchowdhury.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

A portfolio website using only HTML with minimal css. It was a challange to create a website using only HTML.
Well I tried, almost 80% of the work is done using different html tags (some of them I never used in my whole life).
At some point I had to use css, but did not use any external links. I used very minimal inline CSS.
It's really hard to make a website without CSS Grid or Bootstrap Git System, still I tried to make it as elegant as possible.
